# Eventus - RSVP for Crypto Events

This is a simple RSVP app for crypto events. It's built with SvelteKit.
I won't go into how to set it up, figure it out.

What I will use this README for is to document issues for myself.

- [x] Make UI for adding events
- [x] Add page with event details
- [ ] Integrate backend with db to add, read and RSVP to events
- [ ] Consider security of address auth (how will the backend know the address is actually connected, somebody could spam the API, no?)
